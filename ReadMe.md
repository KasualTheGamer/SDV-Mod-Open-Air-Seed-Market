# KTG's Open Air Seed Market

This is a Content Patcher pack that adds a new location map where you can buy seeds without time restrictions, as well as fertilizers, sprinklers, and more!

# What it is

Presently working, there are shops for Flowers, Seasonal Crops (one shop for each season), Special Crops (like mixed seeds and pine cones), and Tools (so you can get iridium sprinklers and deluxe fertilizers right from the start).

# What it is NOT

I'm not going to try to mess around with the seed price values, or rebalancing economies, or any of that. I barely managed to get the map working, dang it!

That said, there were seeds that had no default prices, and so I matched the vanilla base game prices from the other shops where you can get them. Those seeds were: 

- Mixed Crop Seeds (30g, to match Krobus's shop prices)
- Mixed Flower Seeds (30g to match the crop version)
- Strawberry Seeds (100g to match the Spring Festival prices)
- Cactus Seeds (150g to match Sandy's Shop)

I have no idea if my price setting for these seeds will override any rebalancing mods, but it should only happen at the Seed Market Shops. If you happen to write those kinds of mods, and have specific suggestions (preferably with example code included) for any fixes that would make my little seed market work better with your mod, I am open to looking it over. 

# Dependencies

- Content Patcher - this is a content pack for that framework
- Central Station - so you can get to the Market
- SMAPI - so your mods work, at all

# Planned Development

- Adding in some forage via Farm Type Manager could be possible.
- TODO: finish adding the bus stop warp location

# Known "Not Working!"

- See the "Bugs" tab here on Nexus

# Think you can do this better?

This map is heavily inspired by a map that has since been taken down from Nexus, which was titled Farmer's Market, created by NotAGardener. Their idea worked for me, and when they took it down, I thought, hey, a chance to figure out making my own maps! 

Many head thunks later, using just the base game assets and learning from the examples I could scavenge around the net, I put together this small little outdoor map with seed vendors and some trees. 

So, if you think you can do it better, go ahead! Please! In fact, send me a link should you post your take! 

All the image assets I've used are from the base game, and all the seeds are from ConcernedApe or the mod authors of the mods I eventually make this play nice with.
